For a Multi-AZ, multi-region database, the achievable Recovery Time Objective (RTO) and Recovery Point Objective (RPO) can vary depending on the specific configuration and the resources available. In the event of a single AZ outage, the minimum RTO achievable would be on the order of minutes, typically ranging from 5 minutes to 2 hours. This is because the failover process from the primary to the secondary AZ is usually automated and can be completed relatively quickly. For a single region outage, the minimum RTO achievable is also typically measured in minutes, but may take longer than for a single AZ outage as the failover process requires additional data synchronization between the primary and secondary regions.

The achievable minimum RPO for a single AZ outage would be between 0 and several minutes, depending on the replication method used between the primary and secondary AZs. This is because the standby replica in the secondary AZ is constantly kept in sync with the primary replica, so there is little to no data loss in the event of an outage. For a single region outage, the minimum achievable RPO is typically between 10 minutes and several hours, depending on the replication method used between the primary and secondary regions. This is because the failover process requires additional data synchronization between the primary and secondary regions, which can take longer than for a single AZ outage. It's important to note that achieving a low RPO often requires additional resources and can increase costs, so organizations should balance their RPO needs against their budgetary constraints.
